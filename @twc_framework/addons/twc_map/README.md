# TODO
* Map Unfold
* In-game non-global map markers. Players will either have to be within map pointing range to see new markers being placed, or copy markers from another map to see them. Won't affect scripted markers.
* NATO Map Markers for briefing (under a standardised TWC Markers schema)
* Fixes for existing map markers
