# TWC Sounds
This pbo holds the various sounds required elsewhere within the framework (with some exceptions).

The idea is that this pbo is infrequently edited, allowing Bosenator with his dire internet to be able to upload changes to other pbos without having to reupload sound files that are quite large. Additionally, by having it centralised we can follow the common sound classname structure, too.
