# Check Circulation
Anyone

Returns a multi-part string, that has a weighted random element based on their blood volume to simulate the inaccuracy. Medics are more accurate.

Can only be done once every 30 seconds, to prevent meta-gaming (i.e. spamming it and getting different results to pinpoint the blood volume).

The string will consist of the following parts:

-Capillary Refill- (pinch nailbed for refill time)
1-3 seconds = good circulation
3-5 seconds = noticable delay
5-7 seconds = very concerning
7+ seconds = considerable delay

-Rapid Breathing- (muscle oxygen starvation invokes rapid breathing)


# Splint
Medic Only

Attaches to their leg for a period of time, like a tourniquet. Causes minor pain (to simulate discomfort). After X time, it'll automatically come off and have set their bone right.


# (Un)Hook IV Drip
Medical Vehicle Only

Attach a drip to the person, that slowly restores blood over time. Doesn't have a supply like blood bags, so logisticially unlimited. Is much slower, than a blood bag.

Will automatically detach when either they're full, or removed from the vehicle.
